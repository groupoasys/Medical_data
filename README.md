# Medical_data

## Goals ⚽

The aim of this repository is to provide some details of the medical data sets used in paper [[1]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340826631_A_novel_embedded_min-max_approach_for_feature_selection_in_nonlinear_Support_Vector_Machine_classification). This article has been developed by some
members of the [OASYS group](https://sites.google.com/view/groupoasys/home) thanks to the funding of the project [Flexanalytics](https://groupoasysflexanalytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We suggest you visit the related links to know more our research 😉
